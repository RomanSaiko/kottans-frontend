## My progress

###  GIT Basics

I improved my skills at:
* creating repositories;
* reviewing repo`s history;
* adding commits to a repo;
* tagging, branching and merging;
* undoing changes. 

I really liked learngitbranching. It's amazing tool. Thanks to it I understood:
* the key differences between merge and rebase;
* how to use some new to me commands and attributes;

## Linux CLI, and HTTP

I worked with Unix operating system (Mac OS) earlier and quite actively used the command line. It was my first experience with Linux, but it was not difficult because the commands turned out to be very similar.<br>
After completing course "Linux Survival" I learned and understood:
* how to execute different actions on directories and files;
* "home directory" concept;
* how to get system information;
* how to work with processes.

After completing reading articles about HTTP protocols I refreshed my knowledge about:
* HTTP headers, status codes, messages, responses, requests; 
* identification and authentication;
* HTTPS;

and discovered interesting features like:
* types of headers;
* using HTTP in web frameworks examples.
