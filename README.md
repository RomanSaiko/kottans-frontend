## Linux CLI, and HTTP

I worked with Unix operating system (Mac OS) earlier and quite actively used the command line. It was my first experience with Linux, but it was not difficult because the commands turned out to be very similar.<br>
After completing course "Linux Survival" I learned and understood:
* how to execute different actions on directories and files;
* "home directory" concept;
* how to get system information;
* how to work with processes.

After completing reading articles about HTTP protocols I refreshed my knowledge about:
* HTTP headers, status codes, messages, responses, requests; 
* identification and authentication;
* HTTPS;

and discovered interesting features like:
* types of headers;
* using HTTP in web frameworks examples.

## Git Collaboration

Thanks to udacity course I improved my skills at:
* working with remote repositories;
* collaborating with other developers` repositories (forking);

I was surprised by:
* git log, it helps to discover a lot of information about the repository;
* managing PR, it seems simple;

I really liked learngitbranching. It's amazing tool. Thanks to it I understood:
* the key differences between merge and rebase;
* how to use rebase`s interactive mode;
* how to use some new to me commands and attributes;

## Responsive Web Design

I improved my knowledge at:
* viewport features, responsive markup features;
* media query features, breakpoints;
* optimization tricks for tables;

I learned:
* how to set up a testing suite using a combination of physical devices, emulators and simulators;
* the specifics of how pixels on a webpage are rendered and how that impacts the development process;
* the most popular responsive layout patterns and learn the tools needed to implement them in my own designs;

I was very surprised by remote debugging tools. I realized the benefits of remote debugging for mobile and definitely I will use it.

Thanks to Flexbox Froggy I got amazing practise and improved my mastery of flexbox.

It was a great tricky task. I improved my skills at HTML and CSS. I learned how to make keyboard friendly layout and switch across all interactive elements using only keyboard.

## JS Basics

I improved my knowledge at:
* Data Types and Variables;
* Conditionals;
* Loops;
* Functions;
* Arrays;
* Objects;

I learned a lot thanks to practical tasks on freeCodeCamp.org. I also got a good practise experience in solving various tasks.

The most useful knowledge for me was:
* recursion. I understood how this can help me at my future tasks;
* how prevent data mutation (freeze() method) and why immutability so important in modern projects;
* a lot of new array and object methods and how to use them;
* functional programming and it's core principles;

The hardest part for me was solving algorithmic tasks. It was the biggest challenge for me.
